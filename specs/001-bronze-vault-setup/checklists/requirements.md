# Specification Quality Checklist: Bronze Tier — Vault & Filesystem Watcher

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Assumptions section documents Bronze-tier scope boundaries (local only,
  no external APIs, manual reasoning invocation).
- Python and uv are mentioned in Assumptions as prerequisites, not as
  implementation decisions — the spec does not prescribe how to build
  the watcher, only what it must do.
- All checklist items pass. Spec is ready for `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`.
